Dear Chairman of&nbsp;the European Court for Human Rights<br/>
Dear Minister,<br/>
Your Eminence, Cardinal Duka,<br/>
Dear General Attorney,<br/>
Dear Chairmen of&nbsp;both Supreme Courts,<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>
Dear Colleagues,<br/>

It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;great pleasure for me&nbsp;to participate in&nbsp;this conference dealing with fair trial, its limits, and the media. I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;enshrined in&nbsp;the national Czech legislation as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;from the point of&nbsp;view of&nbsp;Article 6&nbsp;Paragraph 2&nbsp;of the Convention on&nbsp;the Protection of&nbsp;Human Rights.

First, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;noted that the national legislation is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the Charter of&nbsp;Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms (Art.2/1993, Coll.), which notes in&nbsp;Art.40 Paragraph 2&nbsp;that a&nbsp;person against whom a&nbsp;criminal proceeding has been brought shall be&nbsp;innocent until her guilt is&nbsp;declared in&nbsp;a court’s final judgement of&nbsp;conviction. The principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence is&nbsp;stipulated in&nbsp;§ 2&nbsp;Paragraph 2&nbsp;of the Criminal Procedure Rules which says: „Until the guilt has been declared by&nbsp;the court’s final judgement of&nbsp;conviction, the one against whom the criminal proceedings has been conducted must not be&nbsp;viewed as&nbsp;a guilty one.” It&nbsp;is interesting that the prepared new Code of&nbsp;Criminal Procedure stipulates that the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence will be&nbsp;defined like in&nbsp;the Charter, i.e. in&nbsp;a positive way, including the emphasis on&nbsp;the principle which says that “the accused is&nbsp;not obligated to&nbsp;affirmatively prove his innocence.” Moreover, this principle will also include the rule _in dubio pro reo_. Even though the definition of&nbsp;this principle stresses especially the rules of&nbsp;producing evidence, it&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;limited only to&nbsp;the area of&nbsp;bringing evidence because in&nbsp;general, this principle also includes the principle of&nbsp;unbiased approach of&nbsp;bodies responsible for penal proceedings. Therefore, the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence should be&nbsp;also viewed as&nbsp;an instrument for the protection and a&nbsp;good reputation of&nbsp;a person before unjustified accusation that he&nbsp;has committed a&nbsp;crime.

In&nbsp;this respect the European Court for Human Rights jurisprudence needs to&nbsp;be taken into account. According to&nbsp;the ECHR, presumption of&nbsp;innocence is&nbsp;violated if&nbsp;for instance, the court or&nbsp;other public authority statement suggests that the prosecuted person is&nbsp;guilty before the person’s guilt was legally proved. This judicial decision also defines requirements regarding acts such as&nbsp;preliminary statements of&nbsp;the court or&nbsp;other public authorities on&nbsp;the guilt of&nbsp;the accused or&nbsp;defendant.[^1] It&nbsp;is also necessary to&nbsp;differentiate between the fact whether a&nbsp;public statement has been made that a&nbsp;certain person is&nbsp;suspected of&nbsp;committing a&nbsp;crime, and a&nbsp;clear statement that a&nbsp;person has committed a&nbsp;crime without the person being legally proven guilty[^2]. It&nbsp;is always necessary to&nbsp;assess whether the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence was violated given the circumstances of&nbsp;a concrete case under which the statement has been made. The principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence prohibits especially those statement of&nbsp;public authorities on&nbsp;the ongoing criminal proceeding which would support the public opinion on&nbsp;the guilt of&nbsp;the suspect, and which would anticipate the assessment of&nbsp;given facts by&nbsp;the court. This principle obviously does not prevent national authorities from informing the public on&nbsp;the ongoing criminal proceedings and investigation. But they should do&nbsp;that with discretion and caution. The ECHR stressed the importance of&nbsp;the choice of&nbsp;words in&nbsp;public authorities’ statements before the person is&nbsp;brought to&nbsp;justice and is&nbsp;convicted of&nbsp;committing a&nbsp;crime.

In&nbsp;this respect the ECHR has only recently dealt with this matter in&nbsp;the Maslarova vs. Russia case. Among other things the ECHR decided about whether the statements made by&nbsp;the public prosecution spokesman had violated the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence. The spokesman noted with a&nbsp;big deal of&nbsp;certainty that it&nbsp;is almost evident that Ms. Maslarova misused public funds. According to&nbsp;the ECHR this statement went beyond the scope of&nbsp;a mere information because it&nbsp;unambiguously implied that the complainant had stood behind the misuse of&nbsp;public funds. According to&nbsp;the ECHR a&nbsp;spokesperson must avoid any semantic ambiguities in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;the ongoing criminal proceedings. Since these statements could be&nbsp;interpreted as&nbsp;categorical claims of&nbsp;a high state representative on&nbsp;the guilt of&nbsp;the complainant of&nbsp;misusing public funds, the ECHR stated that Article 6&nbsp;paragraph 2&nbsp;of the Charter had been violated, and noted that the state and its bodies are obliged to&nbsp;objectively inform on&nbsp;the ongoing investigation or&nbsp;criminal proceedings. The spokesperson and other employees at&nbsp;the court or&nbsp;public prosecution’s offices must abstain from statements that would anticipate the guilt of&nbsp;the accused or&nbsp;the culprit.

The basic rules related to&nbsp;public information on&nbsp;the ongoing criminal proceedings are incorporated in&nbsp;the Czech Criminal Procedure Rules in&nbsp;the provision of&nbsp;paragraph 8a&nbsp;and others. When providing information, the law enforcement bodies must not jeopardize the explanation of&nbsp;facts necessary for the assessment of&nbsp;the case because a&nbsp;preliminary publication of&nbsp;individual facts of&nbsp;the criminal proceedings could hinder or&nbsp;even foil the detection of&nbsp;the criminal case and the conviction of&nbsp;the perpetrator. A&nbsp;special, very strict legal regulation is&nbsp;applied under Act No. 218/2003, Coll., on&nbsp;Justiciary in&nbsp;Suits of&nbsp;Youth, which prohibits disclosure of&nbsp;information on&nbsp;juveniles which could lead to&nbsp;the identification of&nbsp;the juvenile who is&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;the criminal proceedings. The law enforcement bodies must not disclose facts about parties to&nbsp;legal proceedings which do&nbsp;not directly pertain to&nbsp;the criminal activity. This measure protects the person and the personal data of&nbsp;all parties to&nbsp;criminal proceedings. Hence, the law enforcement bodies must respect presumption of&nbsp;innocence laid down by&nbsp;§ 2&nbsp;paragraph 2&nbsp;of the Rules of&nbsp;Criminal Procedure.

The principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence is&nbsp;also inherent in&nbsp;the last clause of&nbsp;§ 8a&nbsp;Article 1&nbsp;of the Criminal Procedure Rules. It&nbsp;stresses that information leading to&nbsp;the identification of&nbsp;a person who is&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;legal proceedings must not be&nbsp;disclosed. It&nbsp;is namely necessary to&nbsp;make sure that certain information on&nbsp;the suspect (later the accused) must be&nbsp;kept secret in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;reduce the defamatory effect of&nbsp;the criminal proceedings as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible. In&nbsp;the next phases the full name of&nbsp;a physical person or&nbsp;other data from which the person’s identity could be&nbsp;recognized, must not be&nbsp;disclosed. Even if&nbsp;the public knows the full name of&nbsp;the suspected or&nbsp;accused physical person, information must be&nbsp;conveyed in&nbsp;harmony with the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence. Namely, the accused does not have to&nbsp;be sentenced but, on&nbsp;the contrary, the criminal proceedings can be&nbsp;abated, or&nbsp;the accused can be&nbsp;acquitted. Law enforcement bodies can disclose information leading to&nbsp;the identification of&nbsp;a person only when it&nbsp;is necessary for achieving the purpose of&nbsp;the criminal proceedings and only to&nbsp;the extent and under the conditions mentioned in&nbsp;§ 8d&nbsp;of the Criminal Procedure Rules. One of&nbsp;the exceptions to&nbsp;the ban on&nbsp;public information is&nbsp;public interest. If&nbsp;public interest and the right to&nbsp;information prevails over the interest in&nbsp;the protection of&nbsp;personal data and privacy of&nbsp;the individual, those data can be&nbsp;made public. This is&nbsp;closely linked to&nbsp;the protection of&nbsp;journalists and their right to&nbsp;disseminate information – journalists must obviously act in&nbsp;good will and provide reliable and accurate information.[^3]

On&nbsp;the one hand, there is&nbsp;the public interest in&nbsp;having a&nbsp;perpetrator of&nbsp;a crime prosecuted and convicted, and therefore, citizens have the right to&nbsp;information about the ongoing criminal proceedings. On&nbsp;the other hand, there is&nbsp;the interest of&nbsp;the accused in&nbsp;having a&nbsp;fair court respecting the presumption of&nbsp;innocence, to&nbsp;decide about his guilt or&nbsp;innocence. When informing the public about the criminal proceedings, the law enforcement bodies must be&nbsp;careful not to&nbsp;jeopardize the crime detection. At&nbsp;the same time, they must respect the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence, which entails concrete requirements for public authorities, including spokespersons. The statements must be&nbsp;formulated appropriately within the meaning of&nbsp;the ECHR jurisprudence in&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;create the impression or&nbsp;conviction of&nbsp;the public about the guilt of&nbsp;a person. Hence, the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence does not prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal proceedings – however, the information about the ongoing criminal proceedings and the procedural position of&nbsp;concrete persons must be&nbsp;clear and accurate.
