# The Prosecutor General’s Office Hosted an&nbsp;International Conference on&nbsp;Relations between the Justice and the Media

Prague, 28th November, 2019 – Is&nbsp;it possible to&nbsp;find the balance between the protection of&nbsp;privacy and the right to&nbsp;inform the public? Is&nbsp;it at&nbsp;all possible to&nbsp;protect the rights of&nbsp;all actors in&nbsp;criminal proceedings in&nbsp;the media environment today? What public interest should prevail? These and other burning questions were the topic of&nbsp;the international conference „Fair Trial and the Media“ which was organized by&nbsp;the Supreme Public Prosecutor‘s Office in&nbsp;cooperation with the European Court of&nbsp;Human Rights in&nbsp;the premises of&nbsp;the Strahov Monastery in&nbsp;Prague on&nbsp;Thursday, 28th November, 2019.

The purpose of&nbsp;the conference was to&nbsp;draw attention to&nbsp;the issue of&nbsp;complying with the principle of&nbsp;„fair trial“ at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;the enormous and omnipresent media focus. In&nbsp;his opening addresss, General Attorney Pavel Zeman recalled the 30th anniversary of&nbsp;the Velvet Revolution: „It is&nbsp;undoubtedly right that both the media and the public prosecution have become self-confident players in&nbsp;our democratic development. But if&nbsp;we want to&nbsp;maintain and cultivate democracy, we&nbsp;regained 30&nbsp;years ago, and if&nbsp;we want to&nbsp;maintain and develop the rule of&nbsp;law, we&nbsp;must realize that every game has its rules.“

A&nbsp;unique combination of&nbsp;speakers offered several perspectives of&nbsp;the ceaseless conflict of&nbsp;adverse interests to&nbsp;spread information, and conversely, to&nbsp;protect them. What kind of&nbsp;aspects of&nbsp;fair trial in&nbsp;relations to&nbsp;the media are in&nbsp;the focus of&nbsp;the The European Court of&nbsp;Human Rights? That is&nbsp;what its President Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos explained: „It is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;inform about the ongoing criminal proceedings responsibly, carefully, and with respect to&nbsp;the right to&nbsp;privacy,“ he&nbsp;stressed. The limits of&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;expression and media reporting on&nbsp;court decisions were the topic of&nbsp;other Strassbourg court judges, Aleš Pejchal and Krzysztof Wojtyczek.

High Public Prosecutor in&nbsp;Prague Lenka Bradáčová explained why information about the ongoing criminal proceedings cannot be&nbsp;completely unlimitted. Vladimír Piskáček, former director of&nbsp;the Economia Publishing House, offered a&nbsp;comparison with the perspective of&nbsp;a practical journalist, by&nbsp;presenting his basis in&nbsp;a recent dispute about the extent of&nbsp;published information in&nbsp;a concrete ongoing criminal case. Media sociologist Marína Urbániková of&nbsp;Masaryk Univerity took an&nbsp;academic position on&nbsp;discussing the issue of&nbsp;information about criminal prceedings and credibility of&nbsp;justice.

The conference was attended by&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;significant guests, Speakers of&nbsp;both Houses of&nbsp;the Parliament of&nbsp;the Czech Republic, Presidents of&nbsp;the supreme judicial institutions, Cardinal Dominik Duka, whose hospitality was used by&nbsp;the Prosecutor General’s Office, and other judicial representatives and public figures.
