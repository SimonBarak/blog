Dear Chairman of&nbsp;the European Court for Human Rights,<br/>
Dear Minister,<br/>
Your Eminence, Cardinal Duka,<br/>
Dear General Attorney,<br/>
Dear Chairmen of&nbsp;both Supreme Courts,<br/>
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br/>
Dear Colleagues,<br/>

On&nbsp;behalf of&nbsp;the Constitutional Court I&nbsp;would first like to&nbsp;welcome all participants. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;thank the organizers for the invitation and for the opportunity to&nbsp;address this important international conference. Over the past weekend, I&nbsp;was thinking about how fair trial and the media correspond with each other. And I&nbsp;must be&nbsp;frank to&nbsp;say that I&nbsp;have not found any satisfactory answer.

The reason may be&nbsp;that we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;times of&nbsp;information inflation or&nbsp;obesity.

My&nbsp;generation used to&nbsp;get information about the world mainly from newspapers. Frankly speaking, until 1990 leafing through just one newspaper and being able to&nbsp;read in&nbsp;between the lines was just enough, because plurality of&nbsp;views was out of&nbsp;the question.

I&nbsp;mentioned “information obesity” which is&nbsp;just the opposite to&nbsp;the former communist “information diet”. Today, information is&nbsp;everywhere: in&nbsp;cellphones, on&nbsp;monitors, videos; it&nbsp;is filtered, personalized, there is&nbsp;so much of&nbsp;it that we&nbsp;are no&nbsp;longer able to&nbsp;absorb it. With the onset of&nbsp;the Internet and its news platforms the traditional journalism started to&nbsp;be fragmented. This fragmentation also concerns media information – a&nbsp;distinction between reporting and commentaries fades away. And so, information mixes up&nbsp;with opinion, conviction with indignation, and facts with sentiments. Bloggers and commentators mostly do&nbsp;not care about facts at&nbsp;all.

Zygmunt Bauman wrote a&nbsp;book twelve years ago on&nbsp;“liquid modernity” which is&nbsp;an outstanding reflection on&nbsp;our modernity. This liquidity moves to&nbsp;media modernity which must be&nbsp;mainly colorful, brief, with catchy headlines, and immediately accessible. I&nbsp;ask therefore, and I&nbsp;am sure I&nbsp;am not alone here, how can we&nbsp;insert such a&nbsp;complex construct of&nbsp;the right to&nbsp;a fair trial in&nbsp;this condensed form? And I&nbsp;will pose a&nbsp;second, perhaps heretical, question: Does the information consumer care at&nbsp;all?

I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;outline several observations from the Constitutional Court practice. I&nbsp;hope they will be&nbsp;informative and to&nbsp;the point.

The Constitutional Court findings are always announced in&nbsp;public, under a&nbsp;relatively big interest of&nbsp;journalists. A&nbsp;detailed justification and considerations leading us&nbsp;to a&nbsp;certain decision, are addressed mainly to&nbsp;them because the public is&nbsp;usually not present. During the explanation of&nbsp;our decision, journalists would manipulate intensively their cellphones and be&nbsp;bored. I&nbsp;would be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;meet with them after the announcement and answer their questions because that is&nbsp;how a&nbsp;transparent and open judiciary should behave. Do&nbsp;you know what their question would usually be?

**Can you summarize today’s decision?** Ten pages of&nbsp;legal arguments they heard a&nbsp;while ago, are forgotten. I&nbsp;would try hard to&nbsp;formulate at&nbsp;least two or&nbsp;three structural theses which support the finding even though all underlying supporting arguments are marginalized. And the next day I&nbsp;would read in&nbsp;the newspapers that the Constitutional Court has intimidated executors. But the reader would not know that not the execution but the right to&nbsp;fair trial in&nbsp;the following legal proceedings, was the issue. Therefore, I&nbsp;must note here that not all of&nbsp;us – fifteen members of&nbsp;the Constitutional Court – are prepared to&nbsp;comment again on&nbsp;the findings to&nbsp;journalist in&nbsp;a condensed form. The audiovisual media in&nbsp;particular are used to&nbsp;put the camera or&nbsp;a microphone in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;you insisting to&nbsp;“explain your decision but only in&nbsp;two sentences.”

What I&nbsp;said does not mean that we&nbsp;should not try to&nbsp;present the results of&nbsp;our work in&nbsp;their completeness. The Constitutional Court issues some 150 press releases on&nbsp;its activities annually. We&nbsp;publish all decisions on&nbsp;the web database NALUS, we&nbsp;are active on&nbsp;the Facebook and the Twitter, and yet we&nbsp;are not able to&nbsp;defeat the media shortcuts.

Unfortunately, that is&nbsp;the reality which I&nbsp;do not like. But if&nbsp;I close my&nbsp;eyes and hold my&nbsp;breath, it&nbsp;does not disappear. Times will not change, and fortunately, those times when the topic of&nbsp;the day was set by&nbsp;the opening page of&nbsp;the only daily are gone. My&nbsp;grandchildren do&nbsp;not read newspapers, they get the information on-line, sort of&nbsp;by the way; they prefer opinion blogs, videos to&nbsp;the news and analyses. The YouTube records 720 000 hours of&nbsp;videos every day, and it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;illusory to&nbsp;think that they would be&nbsp;monitored in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;promote objectivity.

Information obesity and fluid modernity have caught us&nbsp;by surprise. We&nbsp;can require objectivity only from public media which, however, are only a&nbsp;small facet of&nbsp;the whole media spectrum. Since we&nbsp;are used to&nbsp;a quality verified reporting, we&nbsp;do not want to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;terms with the fact that there are many more news reports, as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;they are more superficial, simpler and shorter. If&nbsp;we do&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;write reports about ourselves, and issue our own newspaper, we&nbsp;must modify our media statements. First and foremost we&nbsp;must be&nbsp;more concise, precise and more explicit. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take into consideration that no-one will read dozens of&nbsp;pages in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;understand the gist of&nbsp;the problem. In&nbsp;short, we&nbsp;must begin with ourselves!

This conference will undoubtedly offer many different views of&nbsp;the relation between the court decision and its presentation in&nbsp;the media. I&nbsp;look very much forward to&nbsp;the discussion because the issue is&nbsp;very important, burning and not yet fully grasped. On&nbsp;the other hand, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;point out that courts, including the Constitutional Court, are here to&nbsp;judge, protect rights and provide justice. Their task is&nbsp;neither media engineering and establishing public relations nor waging wars with journalists on&nbsp;who should say or&nbsp;write what, or&nbsp;who should clear up&nbsp;any misunderstanding.

The solution is&nbsp;a dialogue which has three stages: a&nbsp;court decision, its media processing, and adoption by&nbsp;the public. There will always have to&nbsp;be somebody between the court and the reader who will translate, simplify, smooth out and clarify the heavy legal form of&nbsp;information. Therefore, we&nbsp;should not be&nbsp;angry with journalists for spoiling our work, but on&nbsp;the contrary, we&nbsp;should help them seek the way; help them understand, interpret, and pass on&nbsp;our work. Without this dialogue and mutual understanding, a&nbsp;fair process will live in&nbsp;a glass tower, cut from everyday life.

More than ninety years ago, Karel Čapek aptly noted that _„to write for newspapers means especially to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;relationship to&nbsp;everything that exists; to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;keen, direct, democratic interest in&nbsp;the entire reality without intellectual pomp.“_

In&nbsp;conclusion I&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;quote Ortega Y&nbsp;Gasset: _„A clear speech is&nbsp;a politeness worth a&nbsp;philosopher“._

Thank you for your attention.
