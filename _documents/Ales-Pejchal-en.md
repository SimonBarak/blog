Ladies and Gentlemen,

I&nbsp;am greatly honored to&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;an interesting discussion about freedom of&nbsp;speech and protection of&nbsp;privacy before this forum in&nbsp;this beautiful place. When I&nbsp;was thinking about my&nbsp;presentation, I&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the conclusion that it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;both legal and journalistic. It&nbsp;is up&nbsp;to you to&nbsp;assess to&nbsp;what extent I&nbsp;was successful.

![Aleš Pejchal](/blog/assets/img/pejchal.jpg)

I&nbsp;will tell you a&nbsp;story about a&nbsp;very successful prime minister and also two journalists and members of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tribunal established by&nbsp;parliament, but first and foremost, members of&nbsp;human community. Because human community is&nbsp;most important in&nbsp;cases concerning the protection of&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;speech. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;deserted island its one and only citizen can shout whatever he&nbsp;wants, and he&nbsp;needs no&nbsp;protection. There is&nbsp;nobody who would protect him and nobody who would listen to&nbsp;him and could possibly feel outraged by&nbsp;his words.

It&nbsp;is remarkable that it&nbsp;was actually former Syrian slave Publilius Syrus, who in&nbsp;Ancient Rome in&nbsp;the first century B.C. expressed a&nbsp;great thought: „Sibi primum auxilium eripere est leges tollere.“ ”Obstructing the law means depriving ourselves of&nbsp;the basic protection.“ This extraordinary idea will take us&nbsp;through the whole story. But let’s get back to&nbsp;the main heroes of&nbsp;my tale.

Mr. Bartholomew Patrick Ahern was the head of&nbsp;the Irish government for a&nbsp;very long time, from 1997 to&nbsp;2008. During his premiership Ireland was nicknamed “The Celtic Tiger”. The national economy was unbelievably thriving, and the Prime Minister was literally a&nbsp;darling of&nbsp;satisfied citizens almost until his bitter end.

Twenty years before becoming the Prime Minister, Mr. Ahern was a&nbsp;Member of&nbsp;Parliament, he&nbsp;had rather big experience in&nbsp;the government, first as&nbsp;the Labor Minister, and later in&nbsp;a&nbsp;much more significant position as&nbsp;the Finance Minister. And in&nbsp;the period when he&nbsp;was responsible for the national budget, some financial transactions were made which, metaphorically speaking, have later broken his neck.

But let’s not run ahead of&nbsp;events. It&nbsp;is necessary to&nbsp;note here that during his premiership, he&nbsp;paid several visits to&nbsp;the Czech Republic. First, President of&nbsp;the Senate of&nbsp;the Czech Republic at&nbsp;that time Petr Pithart received him in&nbsp;the Senate on&nbsp;21 April 2004. The Irish Prime Minister delivered a&nbsp;speech in&nbsp;the Senate on&nbsp;the expansion of&nbsp;the European Union which was, as&nbsp;all of&nbsp;us know, very topical for the Czech Republic in&nbsp;2004. But it&nbsp;was no&nbsp;coincidence that it&nbsp;was just Mr. Bertie (as he&nbsp;was familiarly referred to) Ahern to&nbsp;address the Czech Senate. Ireland was presiding over the European Union at&nbsp;that time.

Almost a&nbsp;month later, 20&nbsp;May 2004, Mr. Ahern came to&nbsp;Prague again, this time to&nbsp;meet with his EU&nbsp;colleague, Mr. Vladimír Špidla, the Czech Premier at&nbsp;that time. The topic of&nbsp;their discussion was not an&nbsp;ordinary issue, but the question of&nbsp;the adoption of&nbsp;the Constitution for Europe; just a&nbsp;year before the citizens in&nbsp;France rejected the draft of&nbsp;this Constitution in&nbsp;a&nbsp;referendum on&nbsp;29 May 2005, and two days later, on&nbsp;1&nbsp;June, the same did the citizens in&nbsp;the Netherlands.

However, let’s get back to&nbsp;Ireland; Mr. Ahern was somewhat more important there than in&nbsp;the Czech Republic. But if&nbsp;you browsed through the Internet you would have found out that on&nbsp;6&nbsp;May 2008 the Irish Prime Minister involuntarily left his post. Most readers would certainly be&nbsp;happy about the explanation which journalists released on&nbsp;the server “Lidovky.cz“. I&nbsp;quote: ”The details about Ahern’s transactions were first published by&nbsp;The Irish Times in&nbsp;the spring two years ago. At&nbsp;that time the Premier confessed that he&nbsp;had received untaxed financial gifts from at&nbsp;least 39&nbsp;businessmen, but he&nbsp;denied that he&nbsp;had done anything that would be&nbsp;illegal“. This is&nbsp;to say that journalists allegedly made the Prime Minister resign because of&nbsp;suspected corruption.

But the reality was slightly different. In&nbsp;2006 a&nbsp;remarkable story, concerning Mr. Ahern, began to&nbsp;develop, the end of&nbsp;which was written by&nbsp;the the European Court for Human Rights on&nbsp;30 September 2014.

Before we&nbsp;get to&nbsp;the two journalists mentioned above, I&nbsp;should briefly mention the so-called Mahon Tribunal. Under the Tribunals of&nbsp;Inquiry (Evidence) Act of&nbsp;24 March 1921, meaning simply under the act on&nbsp;inquiry tribunals, as&nbsp;amended, the Irish Parliament founded such an&nbsp;inquiry tribunal in&nbsp;1997 in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;investigate into the alleged corruption of&nbsp;politicians in&nbsp;connection with planning a&nbsp;developer construction in&nbsp;the Dublin area.

I&nbsp;cannot avoid pointing out that the respective legislation from 1921 was issued before the conclusion of&nbsp;the Anglo-Irish Agreement of&nbsp;6&nbsp;December 1922 under which free Irish state separated from Northern Ireland which continued to&nbsp;be part of&nbsp;the United Kingdom. However, the tribunal established in&nbsp;1997 was obviously the tribunal of&nbsp;the Irish Republic. And the name Mahon Tribunal was coined because its last chairman was Judge Mahon. The tribunal had all investigative powers which belong to&nbsp;the High Court, including the summons and examination of&nbsp;witnesses, or&nbsp;the request to&nbsp;submit written documents.

The Inquiry (Mahon) Tribunal immediately began to&nbsp;work very hard; from November 1997 to&nbsp;March 2012, the estimated investigation costs were almost three hundred million EUR. It&nbsp;was the longest and most expensive investigation in&nbsp;the Irish Republic.

And finally, it&nbsp;is back to&nbsp;the two journalists: In&nbsp;2006 Mr. Colm Keena was 46, and Ms. Geraldine Kennedy was 55.&nbsp;Both were undoubtedly experienced journalists. At&nbsp;that time, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;reporter on&nbsp;political affairs, and she was the editor at&nbsp;The Irish Times. The tribunal discovered an&nbsp;important clue for its investigation. On&nbsp;29 June 2006 it&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;strictly private and confidential letter to Mr.&nbsp;K., who was a&nbsp;businessman and also a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;Prime Minister Ahern, asking to&nbsp;explain some payments, especially to&nbsp;whom they were paid and why. The issue were the payments from the end of&nbsp;1993, at&nbsp;the time when Mr. Bertie Ahern was the Finance Minister. Mr.&nbsp;K. answered the questions posed by&nbsp;the tribunal through his attorney.

Now comes a&nbsp;version of&nbsp;journalists which can be&nbsp;neither confirmed nor disproved. All of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the whole correspondence between Mr. K. and the Inquiry Tribunal allegedly appeared on&nbsp;Mr. Colm Keena’s table on&nbsp;19 September 2006. The copies were delivered anonymously.

Colm Keena informed editor Geraldine Kennedy. The decision was unambiguous. Check what you can and release it. I&nbsp;suppose 99%&nbsp;journalists would do&nbsp;the same.

At&nbsp;this stage I&nbsp;need to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;comment. Have the journalists proceeded like watchdogs of&nbsp;democracy and the rule of&nbsp;law? Have they discovered anything new as&nbsp;regards the Prime Minister of&nbsp;Ireland by&nbsp;deciding to&nbsp;publish part of&nbsp;the investigation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely independent, professional, democratic institution which had very good reasons not to&nbsp;publish anything for the moment? I&nbsp;will not answer the question but will continue with my&nbsp;story.

On&nbsp;21 September 2006 the whole Ireland and the entire world could read in&nbsp;The Irish Times an&nbsp;article with an&nbsp;explosive headline: “Tribunal Investigates Payments to&nbsp;the Premier.“ The article was based especially on&nbsp;the letter from the tribunal to&nbsp;Mr. K. Whole passages from the letter were used. The author of&nbsp;the article said that Mr. K. was just one of&nbsp;several developers who had offered bribes estimated at&nbsp;50 – 100&nbsp;thousand EURO to&nbsp;Mr. Ahern when he&nbsp;was the Finance Minister. In&nbsp;the article, Mr. K. and the Premier refused any bribes.

This was the moment of&nbsp;the real start of&nbsp;the case which had its final sequel at&nbsp;the seven-member senate of&nbsp;the European Court for Human Rights. This was the tipping point of&nbsp;the events. On&nbsp;the day, when the article was released, the tribunal sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;Geraldine Kennedy expressing concern over the fact that the newspaper had published materials which were strictly private and confidential, and which were labeled as&nbsp;such. It&nbsp;said that publishing these confidential documents before they were assessed in&nbsp;the appropriate procedure, harmed the work of&nbsp;the tribunal and the rights of&nbsp;those who were mentioned in&nbsp;the article. It&nbsp;also noted that it&nbsp;had the right to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;the relevant court in&nbsp;this matter.

On&nbsp;the same day, Mr. K.’s attorneys approached the lady to&nbsp;protest that the mentioned article infringed his rights. A&nbsp;legal war flared up&nbsp;on all possible battle fronts. As&nbsp;regards the Convention on&nbsp;the Protection of&nbsp;Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;fight between Article 8&nbsp;and Article 10,&nbsp;i.e. between the protection of&nbsp;privacy and freedom of&nbsp;speech.

Ms. Kennedy answered the tribunal coldly the next day. Yes, The Irish Times received anonymously a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the correspondence mentioned in&nbsp;the article. However, she considered it&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;public interest to&nbsp;verify and publish everything. Of&nbsp;course, she fully recognized the fact that the tribunal is&nbsp;an important public authority, but the newspapers were obliged to&nbsp;inform the public.

The tribunal objected and released an&nbsp;order on&nbsp;26 September 2006 for journalists to&nbsp;give to&nbsp;the tribunal all documents which served as&nbsp;the basis for the published article. Ms. Kennedy answered the same day that all the documents had been destroyed following consultations with legal experts.

The tribunal decided to&nbsp;summon both journalists on&nbsp;29 September 2019. The journalists obliged and appeared before the tribunal. Nothing more was revealed than the earlier explanation that the materials had been destroyed. Ms. Kennedy only explained that as&nbsp;the editor, she had given the instruction to&nbsp;publish the article because the tribunal could decide that the facts it&nbsp;had discovered about the payments to&nbsp;the Prime Minister would be&nbsp;outside its jurisdiction, and as&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence nothing would have been published.

Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;was then the courts’ turn. The tribunal had to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;the court; meanwhile, journalists were quite at&nbsp;ease. After all, the published article on&nbsp;the Prime Minister was literally a&nbsp;megahit.

First of&nbsp;all, the tribunal had to&nbsp;assess the situation and decide how to&nbsp;proceed. It&nbsp;happened on&nbsp;5&nbsp;October 2006. The three-member tribunal arrived at&nbsp;the conclusion that the behavior of&nbsp;journalists discredited its work and the tribunal had no&nbsp;power to&nbsp;impose any penalty. Therefore, it&nbsp;had to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;the High Court to&nbsp;protect its integrity and the public confidence in&nbsp;its work. The media accused the tribunal of&nbsp;the leak of&nbsp;information. But all tribunal members were convinced that it&nbsp;was out of&nbsp;the question. Therefore, in&nbsp;the interest of&nbsp;the credibility of&nbsp;the tribunal it&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;identify the originator of&nbsp;the information leak, which the journalists precluded by&nbsp;scrapping the documents which could lead to&nbsp;discovering all necessary facts. The tribunal’s activity could not make the impression that it&nbsp;would harm the interests of&nbsp;any involved party.

The action was filed on&nbsp;13 February 2007. The arguments of&nbsp;both parties did not change much. The tribunal claimed that its work could not allow the questioning of&nbsp;the integrity of&nbsp;persons who were investigated, and that is&nbsp;exactly what happened by&nbsp;publishing leaked information. The Irish Times, through Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Keena, adamantly defended any hint of&nbsp;breaking the protection of&nbsp;their source.

The High Court verdict of&nbsp;23 October 2007 concluded that the Tribunal had the right to&nbsp;investigate and to&nbsp;find how the information leak had happened.

The most difficult thing was to&nbsp;assess the balance between the functioning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;democratically established tribunal and the freedom of&nbsp;speech of&nbsp;journalists which included the refusal to&nbsp;publish the information source. In&nbsp;this respect, the High Court concluded that the rights and interests of&nbsp;the third party had to&nbsp;be taken into account. It&nbsp;obviously acknowledged that journalists are not obliged to&nbsp;reveal the source of&nbsp;information, however, the court had the authority to&nbsp;assess all facts and circumstances. By&nbsp;destroying the required documents, the journalists assumed the position of&nbsp;judges who decided the case entirely in&nbsp;their favor, irrespective of&nbsp;the rights and interests of&nbsp;the third party. The High Court described the behavior of&nbsp;journalists as&nbsp;a&nbsp;flagrant violation of&nbsp;the rule of&nbsp;law because they cannot stand above the law and usurp the function of&nbsp;the court, as&nbsp;it happened in&nbsp;this case.
The journalists appealed to&nbsp;the Supreme court.
The verdict of&nbsp;31 July 2009 is&nbsp;very interesting. The journalists neither won nor lost. Many years on, Ms. Geraldine Kennedy called it&nbsp;a&nbsp;Pyrrhic victory.

The Supreme Court basically satisfied the journalists’ appeal and rejected the tribunal’s complaint. It&nbsp;criticized the approach of&nbsp;the High Court concluding that it&nbsp;had been too strict. It&nbsp;was too much focused on&nbsp;the reprehensible acts of&nbsp;journalists destroying the documents and thus depreciating to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain extent the privilege of&nbsp;journalists not to&nbsp;reveal their source of&nbsp;information. But it&nbsp;admitted that the court had to&nbsp;honor journalistic privileges, but on&nbsp;the other hand no&nbsp;citizen, including a&nbsp;journalist, had the right to&nbsp;request the exclusion from a&nbsp;legal process.

However, in&nbsp;this verdict, the Supreme Court did not make a&nbsp;decision on&nbsp;the issue of&nbsp;the statutory costs, it&nbsp;stipulated that the issue would be&nbsp;dealt with separately. With a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;phantasy, this decision could be&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;stack the cards…

And the Supreme Court took its time. On&nbsp;26 November 2009 it&nbsp;released a&nbsp;comprehensive decision which did not spare journalists at&nbsp;all. According to&nbsp;the Supreme Court decision, journalists took the role of&nbsp;arbiters about a&nbsp;proper balance between the relevant interests and rights. The act of&nbsp;scrapping the documents shifted this balance one-sidedly to&nbsp;the benefit of&nbsp;journalists. This criminal, purposeful conduct of&nbsp;journalists deprived them, according to&nbsp;the Supreme Court, of&nbsp;the usual expectations that in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;success in&nbsp;the subject, the statutory costs would be&nbsp;paid to&nbsp;them. The tribunal was competent to&nbsp;conduct investigation which was, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain extent, thwarted by&nbsp;the conduct of&nbsp;journalists, and it&nbsp;was fully authorized to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;the High Court. And, according to&nbsp;the opinion of&nbsp;the Supreme Court, in&nbsp;this quite exceptional situation, the Supreme Court imposed on&nbsp;the journalists, or&nbsp;rather The Irish Times, the duty to&nbsp;pay all the statutory costs to&nbsp;the tribunal of&nbsp;both the High Court and the Supreme Court procedures.

The tribunal evaluated the costs almost a&nbsp;year later, in&nbsp;October 2010. The amount was exorbitant, 393&nbsp;055, 42&nbsp;EUR. However, the amount was the subject to&nbsp;review and assessment of&nbsp;the Taxing Master of&nbsp;the High Court. The proceedings on&nbsp;the assessment of&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;the statutory costs was suspended; and I&nbsp;am sorry I&nbsp;do not know what the final amount actually was.

But before the evaluation of&nbsp;the statutory costs was made, Ms. Kennedy and Mr. Keena appealed to&nbsp;the European Court of&nbsp;Human Rights on&nbsp;19 May 2010.

The journalists complained pursuant Article 10&nbsp;of the Convention on&nbsp;the Protection of&nbsp;Human Rights and Freedoms, that their right to&nbsp;protect their journalistic sources were violated. They claimed that the infringement had neither an&nbsp;evident nor an&nbsp;appropriate legal basis, it&nbsp;did not follow any of&nbsp;the legitimate aims acknowledged in&nbsp;Article 10,&nbsp;paragraph 2&nbsp;of the Convention, and as&nbsp;such could not be&nbsp;considered necessary in&nbsp;a&nbsp;democratic society. Pursuant Article 6&nbsp;of the Convention, the journalists also complained that imposing the statutory costs on&nbsp;them as&nbsp;the successful party was unfair, inappropriate, and arbitrary. They invoked a&nbsp;violation of&nbsp;Article 13&nbsp;of the Convention that they had no&nbsp;effective instruments of&nbsp;remedy in&nbsp;accordance with the convention. Referring to&nbsp;Article 1&nbsp;of Protocol No.1 of&nbsp;the Convention, they also complained that the decision on&nbsp;the statutory costs imposed on&nbsp;them violated their ownership rights. Finally, under Article 14,&nbsp;in&nbsp;connection with the articles of&nbsp;the Convention I&nbsp;already mentioned, they pleaded that they had been exposed to&nbsp;unjustified different treatment than persons in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar situation.

You can look up&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;the Senate of&nbsp;the 5th Section of&nbsp;the European Court for Human Rights from 30&nbsp;September 2014 on&nbsp;the webpages of&nbsp;the Council of&nbsp;Europe. Therefore, I&nbsp;will cut a&nbsp;long story short.  
It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;noted that all proposals of&nbsp;the complainants were rejected as&nbsp;clearly unfounded. And the complaint was declared inappropriate by&nbsp;the majority decision of&nbsp;the members of&nbsp;the Senate in&nbsp;which I&nbsp;was also sitting.

We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;realize that the point of&nbsp;the complaint was the duty to&nbsp;pay the statutory costs, and according to&nbsp;the journalists, it&nbsp;was the violation of&nbsp;several articles of&nbsp;the Convention on&nbsp;the part of&nbsp;the High Contracting Party, and especially an&nbsp;unfortunate infringement of&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;speech. And so, from the reasoning of&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;the Senate, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;probably most important to&nbsp;mention only several crucial principles which were important for the decision:

- Only after the Tribunal hinted at&nbsp;its right to&nbsp;appeal to&nbsp;the court and after it&nbsp;ordered to&nbsp;submit the documents, the complainants – journalists decided to&nbsp;scrap the evidence which was the basis for the court decision on&nbsp;questionable public interests.
- The complainants had the protection of&nbsp;courts to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;defend their rights.
- All persons must respect the role of&nbsp;the courts and no&nbsp;one, including journalists, should usurp the judicial function.
- Finally, the European Court for Human Rights presumed that the real purpose of&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;the Irish Supreme Court was to&nbsp;send a&nbsp;signal that no&nbsp;party is&nbsp;above the law and legal jurisdiction of&nbsp;courts.

I&nbsp;did not tell you this story because of&nbsp;the final decision of&nbsp;the European Court for Human Rights. This story conceals many more questions which are important to&nbsp;discuss in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;speech and protection of&nbsp;privacy of&nbsp;individuals. You would hardly find any similar story featuring a&nbsp;successful prime minister, excellent journalists, an&nbsp;investigation tribunal established by&nbsp;the parliament, national courts, and finally an&nbsp;international court. Therefore, let me&nbsp;complete my&nbsp;story with two observations.

The High Court took a&nbsp;decision at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when Mr. Ahern was the Prime Minister. The Supreme Court took a&nbsp;decision after Mr. Ahern’s resignation. It&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;important, but it&nbsp;definitely is&nbsp;interesting. The other observation is&nbsp;deeper. Mr. Ahern did not resign in&nbsp;September 2006 following the release of&nbsp;those documents which were mysteriously leaked during the investigation by&nbsp;the tribunal which was established by&nbsp;the Irish Parliament. In&nbsp;2007 Mr. Bertie Ahern led his party in&nbsp;the election campaign again, and despite all news articles and suspicions he&nbsp;won the election and became the Irish Premier for the third time in&nbsp;succession.

In&nbsp;February 2008 Mr. Ahern was investigated by&nbsp;judge Mahon again. There was a&nbsp;fierce exchange of&nbsp;views. Mr. Mahon was an&nbsp;excellent investigative judge. The Prime Minister lost his nerve and admitted that there had been some money sent to&nbsp;the account of&nbsp;his former partner Celie Larkin as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loan. In&nbsp;March former secretary of&nbsp;Mr. Ahern, Ms. Gráinne Garruth was unable to&nbsp;bear the weight of&nbsp;evidence, and so&nbsp;she admitted that some money had been deposited on&nbsp;the account of&nbsp;her former boss.
Well, the two ladies and an&nbsp;excellent judge stood behind the fact that the Prime Minister was unable to&nbsp;deal with the old sins, and, on&nbsp;2&nbsp;April 2008 he&nbsp;announced his resignation as&nbsp;of 6&nbsp;May 28,&nbsp;while the journalists continued to&nbsp;be engaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawsuit.

What are the fates of&nbsp;our heroes today?

Mr. Bertie Ahern is&nbsp;68, he&nbsp;is no&nbsp;longer engaged in&nbsp;politics but in&nbsp;February 2015 he&nbsp;won the honorary title of&nbsp;Doctor of&nbsp;Laws at&nbsp;Washington College in&nbsp;Chestertown, Maryland.

Mr. Colm Keena is&nbsp;59, and he&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;journalist at&nbsp;The Irish Times.

Ms. Geraldine Kennedy is&nbsp;of the same age as&nbsp;Mr. Ahern. She is&nbsp;no longer a&nbsp;journalist at&nbsp;The Irish Times. In&nbsp;August 2012 she was appointed the associate professor of&nbsp;journalism at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Limerick. She received the total of&nbsp;five honorary doctorates from Irish universities.

Mr. Alan Mahon is&nbsp;also 68.&nbsp;After four years in&nbsp;the post of&nbsp;a&nbsp;judge at&nbsp;the court of&nbsp;appeal, the Irish government nominated him for the position of&nbsp;the ombudsman of&nbsp;the defense forces in&nbsp;2018. He&nbsp;assumed the position on&nbsp;6&nbsp;July 2018 for the period of&nbsp;three years.

And the Irish community? All of&nbsp;us would probably agree that the period of&nbsp;the Celtic tiger is&nbsp;past history.

I&nbsp;have tried to&nbsp;tell you a&nbsp;story which, in&nbsp;my view, deserves a&nbsp;significant place in&nbsp;law textbooks as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;textbooks on&nbsp;journalism. The questions it&nbsp;evokes, the lessons we&nbsp;can learn, may be&nbsp;more important than the verdicts and decisions I&nbsp;mentioned and in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;which I&nbsp;was involved.

Thank you very much for the attention you paid to&nbsp;this story.
