Dear Prosecutor General,<br/>
Dear Presidents,<br/>
Excellency,<br/>
Dear Minister,<br/>
Distinguished speakers and&nbsp;guests,<br/>

It&nbsp;is a&nbsp;great pleasure for me&nbsp;to open this conference on&nbsp;media and fair trial guarantees. On&nbsp;behalf of&nbsp;myself and my&nbsp;colleagues Judges Wojtyczek and Pejchal, I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;thank our hosts, and in&nbsp;particular Prosecutor General Zeman, for the kind invitation to&nbsp;join you in&nbsp;Prague.

You have chosen an&nbsp;extremely interesting topic for today’s discussions, namely the interrelationship between fair trial guarantees and the media.

The subject of&nbsp;my speech will be&nbsp;the interplay between three different Articles of&nbsp;the European Convention on&nbsp;Human Rights. These are:

<ol class="lower-roman">
<li>the right to&nbsp;a fair trial and the presumption of&nbsp;innocence under Articles 6&nbsp;§ 1&nbsp;and 6&nbsp;§ 2; </li>
<li>the right to&nbsp;private life under Article 8; and</li>
<li>the right to&nbsp;receive and impart information under Article 10.</li>
</ol>

I&nbsp;will begin by&nbsp;briefly outlining each right and its relevance to&nbsp;the reporting of&nbsp;criminal trials.

However, before I&nbsp;do so, I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;the Committee of&nbsp;Ministers of&nbsp;the Council of&nbsp;Europe’s Recommendation Rec(2003)13 to&nbsp;member States on&nbsp;the _Provision of&nbsp;information through the media in&nbsp;relation to&nbsp;criminal proceedings_.[^1]

This text, adopted in&nbsp;2013, summarises the key principles which courts and the media must take into consideration. Indeed, one can say that it&nbsp;is largely based on&nbsp;the Court’s case-law.

## The right to&nbsp;a fair trial and the presumption of&nbsp;innocence

Article 6&nbsp;§ 1&nbsp;of the Convention provides for a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;a fair and public hearing. The Court has found that special protection must be&nbsp;given to&nbsp;the secrecy of&nbsp;a judicial investigation in&nbsp;view of&nbsp;what is&nbsp;at stake in&nbsp;criminal proceedings, both for the administration of&nbsp;justice generally, and for the right of&nbsp;persons under investigation to&nbsp;be presumed innocent.

Indeed, under Article 6&nbsp;§ 2:

“Everyone charged with a&nbsp;criminal offence shall be&nbsp;presumed innocent until proved guilty according to&nbsp;law.”

The presumption of&nbsp;innocence is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the elements of&nbsp;a fair trial required by&nbsp;Article 6&nbsp;§ 1. It&nbsp;will be&nbsp;violated if&nbsp;a judicial decision or&nbsp;a statement by&nbsp;a public official concerning a&nbsp;person charged with a&nbsp;criminal offence reflects an&nbsp;opinion that he&nbsp;is guilty before he&nbsp;has been proved guilty according to&nbsp;law.

The Court has made a&nbsp;distinction between statements which reflect the opinion that the person concerned is&nbsp;guilty and statements which merely describe “a state of&nbsp;suspicion”. The former infringe the presumption of&nbsp;innocence, whereas the latter do&nbsp;not.

However, Article 6 § 2&nbsp;cannot prevent the authorities from informing the public about criminal investigations in&nbsp;progress, but it&nbsp;requires that they do&nbsp;so with _discretion_ and _circumspection_ in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;respect the presumption of&nbsp;innocence. The Court has emphasised the importance of&nbsp;_the choice of&nbsp;words_ by&nbsp;public officials in&nbsp;their statements.

I&nbsp;will give you two examples of&nbsp;how the Court has dealt with the presumption of&nbsp;innocence.

In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;_Allenet de&nbsp;Ribemont v. France_[^2], some of&nbsp;the highest-ranking officers in&nbsp;the French police referred to&nbsp;Mr Allenet de&nbsp;Ribemont as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the instigators of a&nbsp;murder and thus an&nbsp;accomplice in&nbsp;that murder.

This was clearly a&nbsp;declaration of&nbsp;the applicant’s guilt which, firstly, encouraged the public to&nbsp;believe him guilty and, secondly, prejudged the assessment of&nbsp;the facts by&nbsp;the competent judicial authority. The Court has found a&nbsp;breach of&nbsp;Article 6&nbsp;§ 2.

In&nbsp;_Butkevičius v. Lithuania_[^3] the Prosecutor General gave an&nbsp;interview to&nbsp;the media a&nbsp;few days after the applicant’s arrest where he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;had “enough sound evidence of&nbsp;the guilt” of&nbsp;the applicant. Two days later he&nbsp;qualified the applicant’s offence “as an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;cheat”. The applicant was subsequently convicted. in&nbsp;respect of&nbsp;the statements of&nbsp;the Prosecutor General the Court found that while the statements gave some cause for concern, it&nbsp;accepted that they might be&nbsp;interpreted as&nbsp;a mere assertion that there was sufficient evidence to&nbsp;support a&nbsp;finding of&nbsp;guilt by&nbsp;a court and, thus, to&nbsp;justify the application to&nbsp;the Seimas for permission to&nbsp;bring criminal proceedings. The Court took a&nbsp;different approach as&nbsp;regards the Chairman of&nbsp;the Parliament who was quoted in&nbsp;the newspaper as&nbsp;having referred to&nbsp;the applicant as&nbsp;a “bribetaker”.

## The right to&nbsp;private life under Article 8

“1.  Everyone has the right to&nbsp;respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.

2.  There shall be&nbsp;no interference by&nbsp;a public authority with the exercise of&nbsp;this right except such as&nbsp;is in&nbsp;accordance with the law and is&nbsp;necessary in&nbsp;a democratic society in&nbsp;the interests of&nbsp;national security, public safety or&nbsp;the economic well-being of&nbsp;the country, for the prevention of&nbsp;disorder or&nbsp;crime, for the protection of&nbsp;health or&nbsp;morals, or&nbsp;for the protection of&nbsp;the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;others.”

An&nbsp;accused may also complain of&nbsp;a violation of&nbsp;his right to&nbsp;private life as&nbsp;a result of&nbsp;statements made by&nbsp;public officials in&nbsp;connection with pending criminal proceedings or&nbsp;by the media.

I&nbsp;will give you one example here. In&nbsp;_Craxi v. Italy_[^4]\_ \_the accused complained about the Public Prosecutor's decision to&nbsp;deposit material in&nbsp;the registry of&nbsp;the Court which violated his right to&nbsp;respect for correspondence. The Press had picked up&nbsp;on that material (intercepted telephone conversations) and released them into the public domain. In&nbsp;that case, the Court held that the national authorities were not merely subject to&nbsp;a negative obligation not to&nbsp;knowingly disclose information protected by&nbsp;Article 8, but that they should also take steps to&nbsp;ensure effective protection of&nbsp;an accused person’s right to&nbsp;respect for his correspondence.

## The right to&nbsp;receive and impart information

Under Article 10:

“1.  Everyone has the right to&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;expression. This right shall include freedom to&nbsp;hold opinions and to&nbsp;receive and impart information and ideas without interference by&nbsp;public authority and regardless of&nbsp;frontiers. This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of&nbsp;broadcasting, television or&nbsp;cinema enterprises.

Freedom of&nbsp;expression, guaranteed by&nbsp;Article 10&nbsp;of the Convention, includes the freedom to&nbsp;receive and impart information. The Court recalls that freedom of&nbsp;expression constitutes one of&nbsp;the essential foundations of&nbsp;a democratic society and that the safeguards to&nbsp;be afforded to&nbsp;the press are of&nbsp;particular importance.[^5]

Not only do&nbsp;the media have the task of&nbsp;imparting such information and ideas: the public also has a&nbsp;right to&nbsp;receive them. Indeed, the public has a&nbsp;legitimate interest in&nbsp;being informed about ongoing criminal proceedings and the functioning of&nbsp;the judiciary. This constitutes a&nbsp;question of&nbsp;public interest.

The press plays an&nbsp;essential role in&nbsp;a democratic society. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;must not overstep certain bounds, in&nbsp;particular in&nbsp;respect of&nbsp;the reputation and rights of&nbsp;others, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the need to&nbsp;prevent the disclosure of&nbsp;information received in&nbsp;confidence. Nevertheless, its duty is&nbsp;to impart information and ideas on&nbsp;all matters of&nbsp;public interest.

Reporting and commenting, on&nbsp;court proceedings contributes to&nbsp;their publicity and is&nbsp;thus perfectly consonant with the requirement under Article 6&nbsp;§ 1&nbsp;of the Convention that hearings be&nbsp;public.

I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;show the interplay of&nbsp;these three rights by&nbsp;way of&nbsp;one particular case which concerned the dismissal of&nbsp;a chief prosecutor because of&nbsp;statements he&nbsp;had made about a&nbsp;judge in&nbsp;a press release and an&nbsp;interview given to&nbsp;the media. In&nbsp;_Brisc v&nbsp;Romania_[^6]_,_ disciplinary authorities had found that Mr. Brisc had revealed information about a&nbsp;pending investigation and that he&nbsp;had been disrespectful towards the judge as&nbsp;the statements he&nbsp;gave had made it&nbsp;possible for the press to&nbsp;identify her with a&nbsp;money scam.

Mr&nbsp;Brisc complained to&nbsp;the Court that his removal as&nbsp;chief prosecutor for imparting information to&nbsp;the press breached his right to&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;expression. The Court’s task was to&nbsp;consider the balance between the Article 10&nbsp;rights of&nbsp;Mr Brisc, the Article 8&nbsp;rights of&nbsp;the judge who had brought the complaint against him, and the special protection to&nbsp;be afforded to&nbsp;the secrecy of&nbsp;a judicial investigation under Article 6&nbsp;§ 1.

The Court took into account the fact that the applicant had made the statements to&nbsp;the press in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;discharging his duties as&nbsp;public prosecutor, where he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;professional duty to&nbsp;provide information to&nbsp;the press about investigations which attracted media attention.

The Court noted that the applicant had proceeded with caution, refraining from identifying by&nbsp;name any of&nbsp;the individuals involved. The information provided by&nbsp;Mr. Brisc had been “_minimal and general, but necessary so&nbsp;that the public could understand the facts of&nbsp;the case_”. Accordingly, there was nothing to&nbsp;suggest that he&nbsp;had breached the secrecy of&nbsp;the investigation.

As&nbsp;to the judge’s article 8&nbsp;rights, the Court was also not convinced that the press release and interview could be&nbsp;considered as&nbsp;an attack reaching the requisite threshold of&nbsp;seriousness and capable of&nbsp;causing prejudice to&nbsp;her professional reputation.

So&nbsp;what conclusions should we&nbsp;draw about fair trial guarantees and the media? I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;draw three.

Firstly, that the work of&nbsp;courts is&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;constant public debate, which is&nbsp;fuelled by&nbsp;the fact that we&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a world of&nbsp;communication through social media and more sophisticated media coverage. Also, that the public has a&nbsp;legitimate interest in&nbsp;being informed about ongoing criminal proceedings and the functioning of&nbsp;the judiciary.

Secondly, public officials can speak about pending criminal proceedings but their choice of&nbsp;words is&nbsp;important and they must do&nbsp;so with discretion and circumspection.

Thirdly, the right to&nbsp;privacy and private life of&nbsp;the accused must be&nbsp;born in&nbsp;mind.

The three rights I&nbsp;have evoked this morning may conflict. The domestic courts must balance them in&nbsp;view of&nbsp;the facts of&nbsp;every individual case.

Dissemination of&nbsp;the Court’s case-law on&nbsp;this question and others is&nbsp;of vital importance to&nbsp;the functioning of&nbsp;the Convention system. That is&nbsp;why the idea of&nbsp;intensifying cooperation between member states to&nbsp;the Council of&nbsp;Europe, such as&nbsp;the Visegrad Group, is&nbsp;important. I&nbsp;support all efforts to&nbsp;reinforce such cooperation, for example by&nbsp;the creation of&nbsp;a Visegrad Centre for Comparative law.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;extend my&nbsp;thanks once again for the opportunity to&nbsp;address you today. Thank you.
