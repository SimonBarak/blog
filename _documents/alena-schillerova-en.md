Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you for the opportunity to&nbsp;address this international conference which focuses on&nbsp;a burning issue of&nbsp;relations between the media on&nbsp;the one hand, and a&nbsp;fair independent trial on&nbsp;the other hand. The topic of&nbsp;this meeting as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the composition of&nbsp;guests and the audience raises big expectations. I&nbsp;believe that you will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;not only address the very topical phenomenon and related risks, but also to&nbsp;outline solutions which will eliminate any future doubts about guarantees of&nbsp;a fair trial in&nbsp;this country.

If&nbsp;there had ever been a&nbsp;possibility to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;self-regulation in&nbsp;the media, i.e. journalism ethics or&nbsp;journalism codex, I&nbsp;dare say that it&nbsp;is nowadays practically impossible. In&nbsp;my view, in&nbsp;economic terms, the point is&nbsp;it the media inflation. The number of&nbsp;servers presenting themselves as&nbsp;news servers with at&nbsp;least a&nbsp;basic periodicity, has been dramatically rising. While the number of&nbsp;the media houses and journalists is&nbsp;rising, their media food, meaning a&nbsp;potential content, does not significantly change. One day has still 24&nbsp;hours, the government is&nbsp;still the only one, so&nbsp;is the opposition, the school year starts and ends only once a&nbsp;year, interesting technical innovations are not cropping up&nbsp;like mushrooms, crimes and road accidents are luckily not on&nbsp;the rise. Well, the size of&nbsp;the sandpit is&nbsp;more or&nbsp;less the same, but the number of&nbsp;sand cakes increases dozen times every day. Consequently, it&nbsp;results in&nbsp;a chase after sensation, in&nbsp;poor work with sources, in&nbsp;shallowness.

I&nbsp;am not an&nbsp;expert in&nbsp;media studies but I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;strong impression that the significance of&nbsp;a critical reflection of&nbsp;readers on&nbsp;the work of&nbsp;journalists, is&nbsp;fading away, as&nbsp;is the basic reason for upholding a&nbsp;professional self-regulation of&nbsp;reporters: to&nbsp;maintain and promote the prestige of&nbsp;newspapers and reporters. The quantity of&nbsp;the media content which is&nbsp;produced every minute and reproduced by&nbsp;many other sources, makes it&nbsp;almost impossible to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;serious discussion on&nbsp;whether an&nbsp;ethical or&nbsp;legal framework were not exceeded. The significance of&nbsp;one single article is&nbsp;so marginal that the effect of&nbsp;media polemics about it&nbsp;resembles a&nbsp;research of&nbsp;a PhD. student in&nbsp;a darkened archive rather than the way to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;journalist think of&nbsp;self-reflection.

The media is&nbsp;under big pressure so, often times publishing an&nbsp;article with a&nbsp;mistake or&nbsp;unverified information prevails over much needed verification. As&nbsp;a consequence, other media may win the competition to&nbsp;be the first to&nbsp;release the news. That does often a&nbsp;much bigger harm to&nbsp;the particular media than publishing a&nbsp;false news or&nbsp;unverified information.

The pressure imposed on&nbsp;those involved in&nbsp;criminal proceedings, suspects, or&nbsp;judges and public prosecutors face, has been increasing. We&nbsp;can notice a&nbsp;similar situation in&nbsp;the performance of&nbsp;the ministry, when in&nbsp;some tense moments the media attention is&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;our current, or&nbsp;planned moves. Analytics assess them, commentators make predictions, discussions focus on&nbsp;indiscriminate accusations and criticism. In&nbsp;principle, the ministry has to&nbsp;communicate, to&nbsp;formulate clearly the message to&nbsp;be conveyed to&nbsp;the public. That is&nbsp;the most appropriate way to&nbsp;minimalize the space for speculation.

In&nbsp;case the ministry must keep confidentiality rules in&nbsp;line with the law, the situation is&nbsp;more complex because the disproportion between the well-fed and relatively credible speculation and a&nbsp;silent institution which is&nbsp;bound to&nbsp;adhere to&nbsp;strict procedural rules, is&nbsp;considerably big. Moreover, it&nbsp;leaves room for false information. Yet, there is&nbsp;a way for defense: for instance, the appeal to&nbsp;lift confidentiality obligation enables the ministry to&nbsp;defend itself. And still that may not be&nbsp;a guarantee of&nbsp;a serious media interpretation.

I&nbsp;am glad to&nbsp;see media representatives in&nbsp;the audience. Because I&nbsp;believe that the current fragmentation of&nbsp;the media environment will create the space for the renaissance of&nbsp;a quality journalism as&nbsp;a norm. A&nbsp;quality, professional and ethical journalistic work can only exist if&nbsp;produced by&nbsp;quality, professional and ethically minded journalists, and not governed by&nbsp;new directives.

The meeting today is&nbsp;the best way to&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;this postulate.

Thank you for organizing this conference, and I&nbsp;wish you a&nbsp;rewarding discussion.
