_“The right to&nbsp;inform the public, and the right of&nbsp;the public to&nbsp;be informed can get in&nbsp;conflict with equally important public and private interests which are protected by&nbsp;the ban on&nbsp;disclosing confidential information about criminal proceedings.”_

_“The authority and impartiality of&nbsp;the judicial power, the effective prosecution of&nbsp;criminal acts, and the right of&nbsp;the accused to&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence and protection of&nbsp;his private life, are the values we&nbsp;should respect. “_

Let me&nbsp;first stress that I&nbsp;consider it&nbsp;appropriate to&nbsp;set the limits and ways of&nbsp;public prosecution communication with public media officials as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the constitutional basis and related legal limits.

I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;mention the document of&nbsp;the 2014 Consultative Committee of&nbsp;European Prosecutors which contains a&nbsp;recommendation for public prosecutors how to&nbsp;communicate with the media. Public prosecutors are encouraged to&nbsp;regularly inform the public about their activities and ensuing results through the media. In&nbsp;their work they should aspire to&nbsp;be transparent and to&nbsp;win public confidence. In&nbsp;big cases and in&nbsp;disseminating false information about persons or&nbsp;circumstances of&nbsp;the case, the Consultative Committee advises that information should be&nbsp;provided directly by&nbsp;the leading public prosecutor.

Article 17&nbsp;of the Charter of&nbsp;Fundamental Rights and Freedoms generally refers to&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;speech and right to&nbsp;information by&nbsp;obliging national public authorities and local authorities to&nbsp;provide information about their activities in&nbsp;an appropriate way. The conditions and execution are set by&nbsp;the law. In&nbsp;this case it&nbsp;is Act No. 141/196, Coll., on&nbsp;penal proceedings (hereinafter Criminal Procedure Rules). Its provisions § 8a&nbsp;– 8d&nbsp;regulate conditions of&nbsp;providing information about criminal proceedings related to&nbsp;both the physical and the legal entities. The regulations concern protection of&nbsp;information and informing the public by&nbsp;law enforcement bodies, protection of&nbsp;information about criminal proceedings by&nbsp;third persons, ban on&nbsp;publishing some information, and exceptions from this ban. When providing information to&nbsp;the public about their activities, law enforcement bodies are bound to&nbsp;a&nbsp;general obligation not to&nbsp;impede the clarification of&nbsp;facts that are important for the criminal proceedings, not to&nbsp;publish data on&nbsp;persons involved in&nbsp;the criminal proceedings that do&nbsp;not directly pertain to&nbsp;the criminal activity, and they must not violate the principle which says that until the guilt has been declared by&nbsp;the court’s final judgement of&nbsp;conviction, the one against whom the criminal proceedings has been conducted must not be&nbsp;viewed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;guilty one. Moreover, in&nbsp;preliminary procedures, there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;ban on&nbsp;publishing information leading to&nbsp;the identification of&nbsp;a&nbsp;prosecuted person, an&nbsp;aggrieved or&nbsp;a&nbsp;concerned person, and a&nbsp;witness. The above-mentioned notes make it&nbsp;clear that law enforcement bodies have the responsibility to&nbsp;inform the public about their activities, but at&nbsp;the same time, they have the obligation to&nbsp;protect some information from the public.

Law enforcement bodies inform the public about their activity through the public media. The definition of&nbsp;this term is&nbsp;more complex, because the national legislation has not yet reacted to&nbsp;a&nbsp;relatively new phenomenon of&nbsp;the electronic media, or&nbsp;information mediated by&nbsp;the internet. The so-called “new media” is&nbsp;the subject of&nbsp;a&nbsp;general civil regulation which, however, does not fully reflect the specifics pertaining to&nbsp;the mediation of&nbsp;electronic information to&nbsp;the public as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;the traditional media as&nbsp;stipulated by&nbsp;the media law.

The Criminal Procedure Rules in&nbsp;§8c regulates the ban on&nbsp;disclosing information without consent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who is&nbsp;the subject of&nbsp;that information, information about the regulation of&nbsp;interception, and recording of&nbsp;the telecommunication operation, or&nbsp;information thus obtained, telecommunication operation data, or&nbsp;information obtained by&nbsp;shadowing persons and matters if&nbsp;they facilitate the identification of&nbsp;that person, and if&nbsp;they were not used as&nbsp;evidence at&nbsp;the court. At&nbsp;the same time, the CPR §8c contains procedural regulations and exceptions from the ban on&nbsp;disclosure, in&nbsp;which the legislator defined four basic areas when the information, to&nbsp;which the ban is&nbsp;applied, can be&nbsp;disclosed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;necessary extent. The break is&nbsp;possible in&nbsp;cases of&nbsp;disclosing information for the purpose of&nbsp;search for persons in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;achieve the purpose of&nbsp;criminal proceedings. The Criminal Procedure Rules allows for disclosure in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;the implementation of&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;public court trial, and last but not least, when disclosure is&nbsp;in public interest.

One of&nbsp;the basic principles in&nbsp;adhering to&nbsp;the obligation to&nbsp;provide information about criminal proceedings to&nbsp;the public and the performance of&nbsp;competence is&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;proportionality. Essentially, no&nbsp;law is&nbsp;absolute in&nbsp;principle, and when two laws contradict, it&nbsp;is necessary to&nbsp;compare them (Article 4&nbsp;of The Rights of&nbsp;Man and Citizen 1789). In&nbsp;general, courts use tests of&nbsp;proportionality for assessing the principle of&nbsp;proportionality: for instance, the Czech Constitutional Court uses a&nbsp;three-step test to&nbsp;assess the need of&nbsp;interference, its appropriateness, and comparison of&nbsp;the relevance of&nbsp;the two rights.

Under Article 10&nbsp;of the European Convention, everyone has the right to&nbsp;freedom of&nbsp;speech. This right includes the right to&nbsp;take views and accept and disseminate ideas without the interference of&nbsp;state authorities, and irrespective borders. Since it&nbsp;includes obligations and responsibility, the execution of&nbsp;these rights can be&nbsp;subject to&nbsp;formalities, conditions, restrictions, or&nbsp;sanctions stipulated by&nbsp;the law, which are essential in&nbsp;democratic society in&nbsp;the interest of&nbsp;national security, territorial integrity, or&nbsp;public security, law and order, and prevention of&nbsp;crime, protection of&nbsp;health or&nbsp;morale, protection of&nbsp;reputation, or&nbsp;the rights of&nbsp;others, prevention of&nbsp;leak of&nbsp;confidential information, or&nbsp;preservation of&nbsp;authority and impartiality of&nbsp;the judicial power.

The High Public Prosecution Office in&nbsp;Prague based its examination procedures against the Economia Publishing House, which operates the Internet information web site Aktualne.cz<span style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span> on&nbsp;the above-mentioned principles. On&nbsp;12 May 2017, the web published information about the ongoing preliminary procedure concerning misappropriation of&nbsp;the European funds for sports at&nbsp;the Ministry of&nbsp;Education. Criminal proceedings of&nbsp;accused persons were at&nbsp;the very beginning. The information was published immediately after the accused persons were detained, during the decision about their detention. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;noted that one of&nbsp;the detention reasons was the so-called collusion detention, that means the accused could obstruct the criminal proceedings by&nbsp;influencing witnesses who had not yet been questioned. The information disclosed on&nbsp;the web included facts about the intimate relations of&nbsp;the accused persons as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;data on&nbsp;subjects, both legal and physical entities, which should be&nbsp;questioned as&nbsp;witnesses during the criminal proceedings. The author of&nbsp;the public article clearly drew from the police decision to&nbsp;start criminal proceedings, which was delivered to&nbsp;the accused persons and their defenders. The prosecutor of&nbsp;the High Public Prosecution Office in&nbsp;Prague sent a&nbsp;notice to&nbsp;the publishing house to&nbsp;delete the part of&nbsp;the public statement concerning the identification of&nbsp;witnesses and the intimate relations between the accused persons. He&nbsp;also warned the company that in&nbsp;case the notice was disregarded, the company would be&nbsp;fined and thus forced to&nbsp;comply with the notice.

Before the procedural act, i.e. before sending the notice, the public prosecutor considered all circumstances of&nbsp;the case in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;the European Court of&nbsp;Human Rights, and inspired by&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;the Grand Chamber of&nbsp;29 March 2016 in&nbsp;re Bédat vs. Switzerland, he&nbsp;examined the following deliberations.

As&nbsp;regards the necessity of&nbsp;the action, he&nbsp;took into account that the press plays an&nbsp;essential role in&nbsp;democratic society, and although he&nbsp;must not go&nbsp;beyond the limits, especially as&nbsp;regards the reputation and rights of&nbsp;others pertaining to&nbsp;the protection of&nbsp;confidential information, his role is&nbsp;to mediate – in&nbsp;keeping with his obligations and responsibilities – information about all matters of&nbsp;public interest. Under Article 10&nbsp;of the Convention, protection of&nbsp;journalists is&nbsp;dependent on&nbsp;the fact that they act in&nbsp;good will with the aim to&nbsp;provide accurate and reliable information in&nbsp;keeping with the principles of&nbsp;responsible journalism. The concept of&nbsp;responsible journalism also embraces the legitimacy of&nbsp;the journalist’s conduct and the assessment whether he&nbsp;acted in&nbsp;a&nbsp;responsible way in&nbsp;disclosing the information. It&nbsp;is an&nbsp;important, although not critical, aspect. The media’s role is&nbsp;to disclose information about legal proceedings, and the public has the right to&nbsp;learn about the information. However, there should not be&nbsp;reports which could, intentionally or&nbsp;unintentionally, affect the right of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person to&nbsp;fair trial, or&nbsp;harm public confidence in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;courts in&nbsp;criminal justice.

These general starting points were followed by&nbsp;concrete considerations, that means the public prosecutor had to&nbsp;resolve the following questions.

How did the journalist get the respective information? How did the article contribute to&nbsp;a&nbsp;discussion in&nbsp;public interest? What was the impact of&nbsp;the publication of&nbsp;the article on&nbsp;the criminal proceedings, and how did the information affect the private life of&nbsp;the accused persons?

The way the person gets the information which he&nbsp;then discloses in&nbsp;public, and which is&nbsp;considered confidential from the point of&nbsp;view of&nbsp;criminal proceedings, that means not public, can be&nbsp;deemed relevant to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain extent as&nbsp;regards the balance of&nbsp;interests protected by&nbsp;Article 10, paragraph 2&nbsp;of the Convention. In&nbsp;our case, the journalist has obtained information by&nbsp;violating the legal obligation by&nbsp;the third person. It&nbsp;was not stated that he&nbsp;obtained information by&nbsp;acting illegally. However, this conclusion is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;decisive factor because the ECHR general conclusions indicate that professional journalists must know about a&nbsp;confidential character of&nbsp;information disclosed in&nbsp;the article. This confidentiality is&nbsp;evident in&nbsp;the document on&nbsp;which the journalists most probably built. As&nbsp;regards the content of&nbsp;the article, the public prosecutor based his considerations on&nbsp;the conclusions that Article 10&nbsp;does not only protect the essence of&nbsp;information and ideas but also the form in&nbsp;which they are disclosed. Therefore, it&nbsp;is not up&nbsp;to the law enforcement authorities to&nbsp;determine instead of&nbsp;the press what reporting tool the journalist should have used. Freedom of&nbsp;the press includes the possibility to&nbsp;exaggerate to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain extent or&nbsp;even to&nbsp;provoke. But the journalist should distance himself from sensationalism, or&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;reporting to&nbsp;satisfy the relatively unsound curiosity everyone is&nbsp;prone to&nbsp;feel as&nbsp;regards criminal cases. Readers should not create the opinion and anticipate the result of&nbsp;a&nbsp;court proceeding without the least respect to&nbsp;the principle of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence. The public prosecutor perceived the disclosure of&nbsp;information about the intimate relation between the accused persons as&nbsp;almost beyond the limits of&nbsp;publication, even though one of&nbsp;the accused was a&nbsp;public authority representative.

Another necessary question the public prosecutor had to&nbsp;resolve was how the content of&nbsp;the article contributed to&nbsp;the discussion in&nbsp;public interest. Being aware of&nbsp;the fact that the public has legitimate interest to&nbsp;be informed about criminal proceedings, and that information concerning the execution of&nbsp;powers of&nbsp;law enforcement authorities is&nbsp;the subject to&nbsp;public interest, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;consider whether the content of&nbsp;the article and in&nbsp;particular the information which was nonpublic given the stage of&nbsp;criminal proceedings, could contribute to&nbsp;public debate or, whether it&nbsp;served exclusively to&nbsp;satisfy the curiosity of&nbsp;certain readers about details of&nbsp;the private lives of&nbsp;the accused persons. Since the accused persons were taken into custody upon the decision of&nbsp;the court, the journalist could not obtain their statement in&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation when they were restrained of&nbsp;personal freedom, could not effectively defend their rights, and information about their intimate life was disclosed in&nbsp;public.

In&nbsp;principle, the rights guaranteed by&nbsp;Articles 10&nbsp;and 6, paragraph 1&nbsp;of the Convention enjoy the same protection. It&nbsp;is legitimate that the confidentiality of&nbsp;criminal proceedings be&nbsp;granted a&nbsp;special protection due to&nbsp;what is&nbsp;at stake during the proceedings for the administration of&nbsp;justice and for the right of&nbsp;the accused persons to&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence. The nonpublic stage of&nbsp;preliminary proceedings focuses on&nbsp;the protection of&nbsp;the interest of&nbsp;the accused persons, especially presumption of&nbsp;innocence, and in&nbsp;general terms, their personal interest and relations. Confidentiality as&nbsp;mentioned by&nbsp;the ECHR is&nbsp;justified by&nbsp;the need to&nbsp;protect the process of&nbsp;creating views of&nbsp;judges and decision making in&nbsp;justice. And even when considering this principle, the ECHR Grand Chamber assumed that the risk of&nbsp;influencing the criminal proceedings is&nbsp;the reason for national authorities to&nbsp;adopt respective measures such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;ban on&nbsp;disclosing confidential information.

The right to&nbsp;protect good reputation is&nbsp;protected by&nbsp;Article 8&nbsp;of the Convention as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the right to&nbsp;respect private life. For the state to&nbsp;meet the positive obligation to&nbsp;protect the right of&nbsp;one person according to&nbsp;Article 8, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;compelled to&nbsp;restrict, to&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain extent, the rights of&nbsp;another person protected by&nbsp;Article 10. The ECHR assumes that the existence of&nbsp;the above-mentioned civil means to&nbsp;protect private life in&nbsp;the national legislation, does not deprive the state of&nbsp;its positive obligations ensuing from Article 8&nbsp;of the Convention towards the accused in&nbsp;criminal proceedings. As&nbsp;regards concrete circumstances of&nbsp;the case in&nbsp;question, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;reiterated that the accused persons were in&nbsp;custody, that means in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vulnerable position, at&nbsp;the time the article was released.

To&nbsp;sum up, when we&nbsp;generally accept the principle that freedom of&nbsp;speech cannot be&nbsp;and is&nbsp;not the absolute right, in&nbsp;criminal proceedings it&nbsp;is necessary to&nbsp;consider the interest in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fair investigation of&nbsp;criminal acts which can be&nbsp;harmed by&nbsp;manipulations with the evidence, making witnesses not credible, or&nbsp;any other risk on&nbsp;the one hand, and the principle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fair trial, including none of&nbsp;the basic principles of&nbsp;presumption of&nbsp;innocence. The principle of&nbsp;fair trial includes the assessment of&nbsp;possible influence of&nbsp;the trial proper, and the protection of&nbsp;the rights of&nbsp;accused persons, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;the protection of&nbsp;personal rights, that is&nbsp;privacy of&nbsp;persons, both the accused, victims, witnesses, or&nbsp;other persons involved in&nbsp;the trial.

This text was inspired by&nbsp;the decision of&nbsp;the Grand Chamber of&nbsp;the European Court of&nbsp;Human Rights from 29&nbsp;March 2016 in&nbsp;re Bédat vs. Switzerland, including quotations from this decision. This ECHR decision ranks among similar decisions that can serve as&nbsp;guidelines and inspiration for law enforcement authorities in&nbsp;solving legally complex situations.
